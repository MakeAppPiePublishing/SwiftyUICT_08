# Swift UI Complete Training  SwiftUICT_08 - Chapter 8
This is the exercise file for the LinkedIn Learning course *SwiftUI Complete Training* that you can use to follow along with me. If you get stuck working along, you can download the files for the current video to get back on course. 

I've organized this into fifteen downloads, one for each chapter. Download the chapter and decompress the `.zip` file. You will find the videos in that chapter labeled by video number. Refer to the appropriate video for the video number. 

At the end of some chapters, there will be a challenge for you to try your hand at coding in SwiftUI, adding to the project.  

You’ll find in every video selection a `Begin` and `End` version of the project, including challenges. The exercise files will optionally contain an `Assets` folder with images and code that I’ll provide for you.  
  
If you don't do a challenge, pick up from the `Begin` of the next chapter's downloads if you are following along. In some, you will find extra files you’ll import into the project. These are image assets, the models for the project, and a few SwiftUI custom views I’ll start for you to save some time and keep focused on the material.

**Note:** all files are at least iOS 18.0 without any signing capabilities assigned. With the exception of Chapter 14, which may have iOS versions higher than 18. Those will be marked on the video as to minimum version.
